                                    <p>Hoi, my name is Pixel, and I spent a long time creating this because I care about you and I don&rsquo;t want you to end your life. You are important. When reading this, I want you to imagine I&rsquo;m there saying it to you in person. This was created by someone who can relate. Due to my disabilities, my emotions are stronger than most other people’s. I have been through this since I was eight, and I am still here. If I can make it through with the amount of emotions that english can’t begin to describe, so can you. I have had a positive outcome in my life, but it took a decade to truly feel improvement. It might not be easy, and you may take a longer or shorter time than I did, but whatever happens…
KEEP GOING. You got this.</p>
<p>It is better if you read the full note, but if you really don’t want to read it all, you can choose the sections you wanna read or that relate to you. It is highly recommended that you read the intro and final points; the rest is up to you.</p>
