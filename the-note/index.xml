      <description>Hoi, my name is Pixel, and I spent a long time creating this because I care about you and I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to end your life. You are important. When reading this, I want you to imagine I&amp;rsquo;m there saying it to you in person. This was created by someone who can relate. Due to my disabilities, my emotions are stronger than most other peopleâ€™s. I have been through this since I was eight, and I am still here.</description>
